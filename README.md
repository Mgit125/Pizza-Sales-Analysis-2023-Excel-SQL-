Trend Identification: Identify busiest days, months, quarters, and times to understand peak demand periods.
Product Performance: Analyze sales performance by pizza category, size, and individual pizza items.
Visualization: Create an interactive Excel dashboard to visually represent key findings and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

### Methodology

Data Import and Database Creation:

Import the CSV/flat file into MS SQL Server.
Create the Pizza_sales_2023_DB database.
